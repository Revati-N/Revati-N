## 💡 Projects & Experience
<ul>
  <li> <b>Resume Analysis using RAG</b> - Developed an intelligent document processing system integrating LangChain, Ollama LLM, and vector embeddings.  </li>
  <li> <b>Image Inpainting and Forgery Detection System</b> - Independently developed a computer vision system for forgery detection, achieving 95.52% accuracy, by leveraging a large publicly available image dataset and using image inpainting techniques on it. Designed and trained a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) to identify forgery by learning image-level inconsistencies, and deployed the solution with a Streamlit-based UI for real-time user interaction, enabling efficient digital forensics and visual verification. </li>
  <li> <b>ECG-Based Arrhythmia Classification System</b> - Conducted comparative analysis of machine learning and deep learning models for cardiac arrhythmia detection using the MIT-BIH dataset, achieving 97.32% accuracy with the Random Forest classifier. Implemented comprehensive data preprocessing techniques and evaluated model performance using multiple metrics to identify the most reliable approach for real-time clinical arrhythmia detection. </li>
  <li> <b> Phishing URLs Classifier</b> - Built a robust ensemble learning model that classifies URLs with enhanced accuracy.  </li>
  <li> <b>Diabetes Prediction Model</b> - Achieved superior accuracy using a Linear Stacking Classifier, with research published in an international conference.</li>
</ul>
